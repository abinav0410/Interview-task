# Technical Interview Project: AI Negotiation Agent

## üéØ The Challenge
Build a BUYER agent using Google DeepMind's Concordia framework that can successfully negotiate against our hidden SELLER agent. If your agent achieves profitable deals while maintaining character consistency, you advance to the next interview round.

**Time Limit**: 3-4 hours  
**Success Criteria**: Achieve at least 2 profitable deals out of 3 test scenarios

---

## üìã Project Overview

### Your Mission
Create an AI-powered buyer agent that can:
1. Negotiate effectively for mangoes and other perishable goods
2. Stay within budget constraints while maximizing savings
3. Maintain a consistent personality throughout negotiations
4. Close deals before timeout (10 rounds max)

### What We Provide
- Base template with Concordia integration
- Sample products and test scenarios
- Mock seller for local testing
- Evaluation framework

### What You Build
- A complete BUYER agent with unique personality
- Negotiation strategy using Concordia components
- Memory system for tracking conversation context
- Decision logic for when to accept/counter/walk away

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. **Framework**: Google DeepMind's Concordia (Required)
```bash
# Install Concordia
pip install git+https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia.git
```

### 2. **Core Components to Implement**

#### Required Concordia Components:
- **Memory Component**: Store and retrieve negotiation history
- **Personality Component**: Define consistent character traits
- **Observation Component**: Process seller messages and offers
- **Decision Component**: Implement negotiation strategy

#### Component Structure:
```python
class BuyerPersonalityComponent(entity_component.ContextComponent):
    """Your agent's personality definition"""
    
    def make_pre_act_value(self) -> str:
        # Return personality context for LLM
        pass
    
    def get_state(self):
        # Return current state for serialization
        pass
    
    def set_state(self, state):
        # Restore from saved state
        pass
```

### 3. **Language Model**
- Use Llama-3-8B via ollama or AWS Bedrock or HuggingFace

---

## üéÆ Game Rules

### The Negotiation Process
1. **Roles**: You build a BUYER, we test it against our SELLER
2. **Hidden Information**: 
   - Your agent knows its maximum budget
   - Seller's minimum price is hidden
3. **Win Conditions**:
   - Close deal within budget
   - Achieve meaningful savings
   - Complete within 10 rounds

### Scoring Breakdown
- **Deal Success** (40%): Did you close the deal?
- **Savings Achieved** (30%): How much below budget?
- **Character Consistency** (20%): Did you maintain personality?
- **Code Quality** (10%): Clean, modular implementation

## üé≠ Choose Your Agent's Personality

Pick one archetype or create your own:

### Option 1: The Aggressive Negotiator
- Starts with low offers (60-70% of market)
- Uses pressure tactics
- Threatens to walk away
- Makes large jumps when necessary

### Option 2: The Diplomatic Buyer  
- Builds rapport first
- Makes reasonable offers (80-85% of market)
- Seeks win-win outcomes
- Gradual concessions

### Option 3: The Data Analyst
- Quotes market research
- Uses logical arguments
- Calculates fair prices
- Decisions based on data

### Option 4: Custom Personality
- Define your own unique traits
- Document the strategy
- Bonus points for creativity

## üí° Tips for Success

### Strategy Tips
1. **Opening Offers**: Start strong but realistic
2. **Concession Pattern**: Plan your negotiation trajectory
3. **Deadline Awareness**: Don't let negotiations timeout
4. **Personality Consistency**: Stay in character even under pressure

### Technical Tips
1. **Memory Usage**: Store key information from each round
2. **Component Design**: Keep components modular and testable
3. **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases gracefully
4. **State Management**: Properly implement get/set state

### Common Pitfalls
- ‚ùå Exceeding budget constraints
- ‚ùå Breaking character when desperate
- ‚ùå Ignoring seller's messages
- ‚ùå Poor time management (timeout)
